This project has an array of programming anecdotes. Clicking the 'new anecdote' button chooses another random
anecdote from this array (it will always choose an anecdote that is not currently displayed). Each anecdote
also has a number of votes associated with it, and clicking the 'vote' button increments the count for that
anecdote. The second section keeps track of the anecdote with the most votes and displays it, along with its
current number of votes.
